A2:
*** when the user does not provide a .config extension when saving a file, make sure to append it (first test if .config is there)

-graphic buttons
-NEW:
--if a project is currently opened (NOT NEW -- openFlag==TRUE): check if it has been changed. if changed,give the user the option to save it
--if a project is currently NEW (no files opened -- openFlag==FALSE), then the user should be prompted for the name of the saved file(s). Note: the file that is associated with the project should have a .config extension. 
-OPEN:
** what if a project is new but it hasn't been changed? ** (may have to implement a "newFlag")
--if a project is currently opened and modified (openFlag == TRUE and modFlag == TRUE) the user should be given the option to save it if it has been changed
--if the current project is new (openFlag==FALSE and modFlag==TRUE/FALSE and newProj==TRUE), the user should be prompted for a name for the project; the file associated with the project should have a .config extension
-SAVE:
--if the current project is new (modified==TRUE or not) the user should be prompted for a file name for the project (note: add a .config extension)
-SAVE AS:(save the current opened file/project with a new name)
--the user should be provided with a dialog to save a project with a new name (keeping in mid the .config extension)
--IF the project is already named (if newProj==FALSE--keep in mind the .config extension), that name should be already loaded into the filename box
-QUIT: 
--if a project is already opened (modFlag==TRUE) the user should be prompted to save it

*** REV DIR CREATION
-COMPILE: compiles the currently loaded file
--the compiled application (the collection of .java source files that implements the dialog box) should be created in a subdirectory with the same name as the project file -- with a .java extension). IE: strip ".config" and replace it with ".java"
--if the project is new and/or unsaved (modFlag==TRUE AND/OR openFlag==TRUE) the user should be prompted to save it, and give it a name. if there already exists a project with the same name ast that which would be created, a yes/no dialog (confirmation) box should be presented asking if the file(s) should be overwritten.
*** ERRORS IN COMPILATION: should be written to a separate pop-up text window with a scrollbar and a single dismiss button that closes this window.
--COMPILE AND RUN: identical to the "compile" option. on successful compilation the resulting Java application should be compiled and executed immediately.

-CONFIG:
--Java Compiler:
